# Iceberg Demo

We're the analytics team from Big Ecommerce Store, and we've been tasked with creating an analytics
suite based off the data we have lying in the data lake.

We will create a dashboard to expose the following key metrics:

- Hourly Purchase Distributions
- Weekday Purchase Distributions
- Views per purchase per session
- Most popular categories

We want to filter on the following fields:
- Brand
- Event Time
